- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, This is Juan Micolta from Colombia.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about Data related topics by myself, so I'm taking classes online in platforms like Udemy, Platzi, Coursera, YouTube and other ones.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Git and Github. I started my way in Programming learning about SQL, and a little bit about the Python language. Also I've studied about JSON format and API Rest using Postman platform. After finish the Git and GIthub proffesional course, I will continue learning Python programming.    
- At the same time, my idea is continue improving my English speaking skills in order to get more and better jobs opportunities in a near future. That's one of my personal goals. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my personal whatsapp only if you know me in person. Thanks.



Update: May, 2025.
- I'm AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner since Aug, 2023. I'm currently working in the field for a Data Engineer. I have re-taken my Python learning journey; however, I just started two months ago, therefore, I'm still building my fundational knowledge for this programming language. My current learning path is focused on the Data Engineering field. This path, includes learning how to use the Pandas framework, API basics, Airflow, CI/CD, PySpark, Unit testing, distribuited systems, DBT, Python scripting/automation, Docker/Containers, PowerAutomate, and other more.
